# Least Count Score Tracker — Tasks

## Planning
- [x] Gather requirements and answer user questions
- [x] Decide tech stack (Expo + React Native)
- [x] Write implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval on plan

## Project Setup
- [x] Create Expo project with TypeScript template
- [x] Install dependencies (Reanimated, AsyncStorage, Haptics, LinearGradient)
- [x] Set up Expo Router file-based navigation
- [x] Configure theme constants (colors, fonts, spacing)

## Screens & UI
- [x] Home screen — New Game + Game History
- [x] Player Setup screen — Add/remove players
- [x] Scorecard screen — Score table + sticky headers/totals
- [x] NumPad component — Bottom-sheet numeric keypad
- [x] Confetti component — Winner celebration
- [x] Toast component — Notifications

## Game Logic
- [x] Core game logic (create, addRound, setScore, undo)
- [x] Auto-sum, elimination (201+), warning (150+)
- [x] Winner detection (last player standing)
- [x] AsyncStorage persistence (save/load games)

## Animations & Polish
- [x] Page transitions (fade)
- [x] Score cell entry animations (pulse on change)
- [x] Elimination badge (✕) + reduced opacity
- [x] Winner confetti + crown animation
- [x] Warning styling at 150+

## Bug Fixes
- [x] B1: Error state when game not found (instead of infinite loading)
- [x] B2: Sentinel constant SCORE_NOT_ENTERED replaces magic number -1
- [x] B3: Auto-add new round when current round is complete
- [x] B4: GameCard animation uses stable game.id dep
- [x] B5: Splash background color matches COLORS.background (#000000)

## Code Quality
- [x] C1: Named SCORE_NOT_ENTERED constant in gameLogic.ts
- [x] C2: Duplicate player name validation in setup screen
- [x] C7: Stable keys for player chips (numeric ID instead of name+index)
- [x] C8: useCallback on all handlers in scorecard screen

## UX Improvements
- [x] U1: Auto-advance to next empty cell after score submit
- [x] U2: Long-press hint text on game history
- [x] U3: Confirm before closing only if game is in progress
- [x] U4: Round total column per row
- [x] U6: Quick-zero button in NumPad for round winners

## Features
- [x] Horizontal scroll for scorecard with 5+ players
- [x] Sticky header row (player names stay visible)
- [x] LinearGradient on New Game button
- [x] Read-only "final scores" mode for finished games
- [x] Elimination ✕ badge on totals row

## Build / Config
- [x] Configure eas.json for APK builds
- [x] Remove unused dependency (react-native-svg)
- [x] Fix splash background color mismatch
- [x] Asset files verified (icon, splash, adaptive-icon, favicon)

## Verification
- [ ] Full flow test in Expo Go
- [ ] APK install + test on device
